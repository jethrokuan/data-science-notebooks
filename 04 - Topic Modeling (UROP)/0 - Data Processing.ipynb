Laboratory School of Electrical and Computer Engineering National Technical University of Athens eangelou npapa ikons dtsouma nkoziriscslabecentuagr ABSTRACT Modern cloud infrastructures based on virtual hardware provide new opportunities and challenges for developers and system administrators alike Most notable is the promise of resource elasticity whereby the infrastructure can increase or decrease in size based on demand Utilizing elastic resources applications can provide better quality of service and reduce cost by only paying for the required amount of resources In this work we extensively study the performance of some popular NoSQL databases over an elastic cloud infrastructure NoSQL databases focus on analytical processing of large scale datasets oering increased scalability over commodity hardware We then proceed to describe TIRAMOLA a cloudenabled framework for automatic provisioning of elastic resources on any NoSQL platform Our system administers cluster resources VMs according to useror applicationspecied constraints through an expandable monitoring and commandissuing module Users can easily modify resizing policies based on applicationspecic metrics and thus fully utilize the elasticity of the underlying infrastructure As a realistic usecase we apply this framework on top of a fully distributed RDF store backed by an elastic NoSQL database Letting TIRAMOLA manage the number of committed resources results in automated cluster resize actions and throughput maximization while application experts need only provide simple elasticity rules INTRODUCTION Cloud Computing has been receiving an increasing amount of attention from both the industry and academia Ondemand and payasyougo access to computational and storage resources that reside in distant data centers is a very attractive business model especially for small to mediumsized enterprises SMEs and startups that require straightforward access to scalable hardware and software infrastructures without the administrative costs This model drives the proliferation of cloud platforms that provide infrastructure as a service IaaS such as Amazon s elastic compute cloud EC or its opensource alternatives such as Euca Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or

requires prior specic permission andor a fee SWIM May Scottsdale Arizona USA Copyright ACM lyptus and OpenStack The use of cloud APIs allows administrators to resize virtual infrastructures in terms of the number of virtual machines the number of virtual cores memory and storage space etc so as to satisfy their applications needs The computational and storage requirements of applications such as web analytics business intelligence and social networking over teraor even peta byte datasets have pushed on premise infrastructures to their limits and drive the adoption of the Infrastructure as a Service IaaS paradigm over the Cloud These needs have led to the development of horizontally scalable distributed nonrelational data stores called NoSQL databases Google s Bigtable and its opensource implementation HBase Amazon s Dynamo Facebook s Cassandra and LinkedIn s Voldemort are a representative set of such systems NoSQL systems exhibit the ability to store and index arbitrarily big data sets while enabling a large amount of concurrent user requests Data generated through the integration and interlinking of diverse Web sources exhibit such features These datasets are stored and queried using the RDF framework and the SPARQL language respectively in several Semantic Web applications The ultimate goal is to utilize and combine these datastores in order to extract knowledge through Linked Data processing It is clear that this extraction can be achieved by utilizing scalable data management techniques and infrastructures A number of horizontally scalable RDF datastores eg have been recently introduced towards this direction NoSQL datastores ability to scale horizontally makes them perfect candidates for cloud platforms that provide infrastructure as a service IaaS and applications based on them will exploit their characteristics Scalability in processing big data is possible through elasticity and sharding The former refers to the ability to expand or contract dedicated resources in order to meet the exact demand The latter refers to the horizontal partitioning over a sharednothing architecture that enables scalable load processing It is obvious that these two properties henceforth referred to as elasticity are intertwined as computing resources grow and shrink data partitioning must be done in such a way that no loss occurs and the right amount of replication is conserved Many NoSQL systems eg claim to oer adaptive elasticity according to the number of participant commodity nodes Nevertheless the throttling is usually performed manually making availability problems due to unanticipated high loads not infrequent eg the recent Foursquare outage Adaptive frameworks are oered by major cloud vendors as a service through their infrastructure Amazon s SimpleDB Google s AppEngine and Microsoft s SQL Azure are proprietary systems provided through a simple REST interface oering virtually unlimited processing power and storage However these services run on dedicated servers ie no elasticity from the vendor s point of view their internal design and architecture is not publicly documented their cost is sometimes prohibitive and their performance is questionable Recent works have provided interesting insights over the performance and processing characteristics of various analytics platforms eg without dealing with elasticity in virtualized resources which is the typical case in cloud environments The studies presented in deal with this feature but do not address NoSQL databases while is lesystem specic Finally proprietary frameworks such as Amazon s CloudWatch or AzureWatch do not provide a rich set of metrics and require a lot of manual labor to be applicable for NoSQL systems Thus although both NoSQL and cloud infrastructures are inherently elastic there exist no detailed and extended studies to report how eective this is in practice at least over architecturally dierent engines Our work aims to bridge this gap between individual implementations and practice Besides the inherent elasticity constraints NoSQL engines exhibit our task is to deploy a distributed framework that allows in a customizable and automated manner NoSQL platforms to expand or contract their resources by using a cloud management platform In this work we make the following tangible contributions We document the costs and gains after a cluster resize and a data rebalance operation Using both client and clusterbased metrics we register the performance gains when increasing the size of the cluster under varying generic workloads with and without rebalancing operations We present TIRAMOLA an opensource prototype implementation of our framework that performs distributed monitoring at various granularities of a NoSQL platform and automates the cluster resize process according to userdened policies As a case study we apply TIRAMOLA on a distributed RDF datastore which supports the storage and indexing of RDF data along with the ecient resolution of join queries Through the application of a varying workload and the use of a simple policy we demonstrate TIRAMOLA s ability to perform correct cluster resize operations as the cluster increases and decreases its size in order to maximize the reported throughput The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section presents TIRAMOLA s architecture Section outlines our results Section presents related work and Section con cludes our work by briey highlighting our ndings ARCHITECTURE TIRAMOLA our elasticitytesting framework is an opensource project with over K lines of Python code Its architecture is depicted in Figure It consists of a number of conguration management and monitoring modules which interact with both the IaaS and PaaS layers of a sharednothing distributed application sitting on top of a httptiramolagooglecodecom Figure The TIRAMOLA NoSQL elasticitytesting framework cloud platform More specically it comprises of the higherlevel Command Issuing and Rebalancing modules which are responsible for initiating cluster resize operations and ensuring equal load distribution respectively The lower level components of TIRAMOLA are the Cloud Management the Cluster Coordinator and the Monitoring module The Cloud Management module interacts with the cloud vendor s IaaS level to adjust the cluster s physical resources by releasing or acquiring more virtual machines The Cluster Coordinator executes higher level add remove and rebalance commands according to the particular NoSQL system used on the PaaS cloud level Finally the Monitoring module collects fresh and up to date metrics both from the application PaaS and the infrastructure IaaS layer In the following we describe in detail the aforementioned modules The Command Issuing module coordinates the entire resource adjustment process It currently requests addition or removal of a number of VMs using the Cloud Management and the Cluster Coordinator modules The user can dene a set of policies which can trigger dierent cluster resize events The policies are based on metrics retrieved by the Monitoring module Their complexity can vary from simple threshold based policies eg trigger node removals when the cluster s CPU usage is very low for a long time to more sophisticated application specic policies eg trigger node additions when there is a sudden increase in the mean query response time Currently this module requests addition or removal of a number of VMs using the Cloud Management and Cluster Coordinator modules TIRAMOLA s Monitoring module is designed and deployed in order to gather both generic IaaS related and specic PaaS related metrics Currently it receives data from Ganglia a scalable distributed system monitoring tool that allows the user to remotely collect live or historical IaaS statistics such as CPU load averages network memory or disk space utilization through its XML API and present them through its web frontend via realtime dynamic web pages Apart from general operatingsystem statistics Ganglia may also gather PaaS related metrics such as the current number of open client threads number of served operations per second etc The Rebalancing module is activated after successful TIRAMOLA Cloud Issuing commands ie a newly requested VM has booted and received a valid IP When this happens the module executes a global rebalance operation in which client requests are spread equally among the cluster nodes according to the specic NoSQL implementation TIRAMOLA s Cloud management module interacts with the cloud vendor using the well known eucatools an Amazon EC compliant RESTbased client library The command issuing module interacts with this module when it commands for a resize in the physical cluster resources ie the number of running VMs Our cloud management platform is a private OpenStack installation The use of eucatools guarantees that our system can be deployed in Amazon s EC or in any ECcompliant IaaS cloud We have created an Amazon Machine Image AMI that contains preinstalled versions of the supported NoSQL systems along with the Ganglia monitoring tool The Cluster coordinator module issues higher level PaaS management commands after the requested infrastructure has been successfully reserved and initialized by the Cloud Management module This coordination is done with the remote execution of shell scripts and the injection of onthey created NoSQL specic conguration les to each VM Higher level start cluster add NoSQL node and remove NoSQL node commands are translated in a workow of primitive remote commands and conguration le transfers Our framework implementation executes health checks and makes sure that each step has succeeded before moving to the next The following scenario depicts TIRAMOLA s module collaboration during a cluster resize the Command Issuing module identies an overloaded situation by utilizing info from the Monitoring module and requests an add virtual machine command using the eucatools API and waits until it is started and has been assigned with an IP After this the Cluster Coordinator creates the appropriate conguration scripts onthey transfers them to the new VM and remotely starts the NoSQL service along with the Ganglia tool The Rebalancer module inserts the node to the cluster and rebalances client requests among the server nodes Alternatively when the decision dictates for node deletion the Cluster Coordinator is instructed to remove it from the cluster calling the terminate instance command of the Cloud Management Data loss during node removal is avoided with the use of NoSQL data replication In this case NoSQL systems transparently replicate the removed data in order to maintain the replication factor Our framework currently incorporates two popular NoSQL systems that implement rebalancing operations HBase and Cassandra Yet the system is extensible enough to include more engines that support elastic operations by implementing the system s abstract primitives in the Cluster Coordinator module and by including the system s binaries to the existing AMI virtual machine image The precooked virtual machine image is available for download from the project s web site EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Our experimental setup consists of an OpenStack private cluster of VM containers with one machine also serving as the Cloud endpoint scheduler storage and networking cluster controller Each VM container has core Intel Xeon R CPUs with Hyperthreading at GHz GB of RAM with disabled page swapping and two TB disks setup with RAID for maximum disk IO Thus the cluster can support a total of small VMs Each of our server VMs has a virtual core processor with GB of RAM and GB of storage space It therefore corresponds to a type medium Amazon VM Cluster peers store their data into their root le system ie no external Elastic Block Storage EBS is used The versions of Hadoop and Ganglia used are and respectively both in their default conguration Clients and workloads used We utilize xed HBase v and Cassandra v beta initial cluster sizes of nodes which are loaded with million objects ie GB of plain raw data since each item takes up KB by utilizing the YCSB load function Other standard benchmarks such as TPCW focus mainly on relational databases and we have opted for analytical rather than transactional database load given the scope of NoSQL databases Every database is congured with a replication factor of which in the case of Cassandra and HBase results in a total database size of about GB and GB respectively HBase uses more metadata per record Since HBase and Cassandra are implemented in Java and they were setup for production mode a generous heap space of GB was supplied For the most part all database systems were setup using their default settings as presented in their online manual pages The only deviation from this rule is Cassandra s autobootstrap parameter which was set to false as it eectively prevents adding more nodes to the cluster ring than the number of already participating nodes The default workload for the YCSB tool is random uniform read with varying where is the number of active threads of the YCSB tool YCSB uses two parameters the number of threads per client and the target number of operations per second they will try to achieve Consequently denes the number of concurrent pending operations at every time point In our experiments we pose a sucient number M to M of simple get queries that collectively cover a signicant part of the dataset to YCSB comes with a set of workloads that simulate realworld conditions However we use consistent workloads namely UNIFORM READ ZIPFIAN READ UNIFORM UPDATE and UNIFORM RMW in order to better understand the databases behaviour for dierent types of load These are simple ie not composite workloads where all operations are of the dened type that is uniform random reads zipan random reads uniform random updates and uniform random readmodifywrites respectively Our evaluation conforms to the following methodology First we identify the cost and performance gainloss cost after cluster resize for various workloads and resize choices Then given our ndings we present a prototype fully automated system where the command issuing module monitors the appropriate performance metrics and adaptively addsremoves cluster resources in order to keep the cluster within some userdened limits Finally we present a prototype system based on a SPARQL application backed by HBase and evaluate our elasticityproviding system s implementation Cluster resize performance measurements Data rebalancing costs Our primary concern on the costs and gains of a cluster resize operation relates to the rebalancing of the database data As data rebalancing is a resource intensive procedure we perform node additions and Table Completion time total moved data nal average query throughput and latency for a node cluster resize operation in HBase and Cassandra with and without data rebalancing Metric Cluster HBase Cassandra Reb No Reb No Completion time min Data moved GB Througput Kreqss Avg Latency s data migration only on an idle cluster that is without applying extra client load This is a valid scenario because data rebalancing is normally scheduled during opeak time periods Moreover in experiments conducted with extra client workload during data rebalancing both systems exhibited erratic behaviour and never achieved the throughput or latency performance of the original cluster before the resize operation Even worse DB clients received disconnects and inconsistencies resulting in a signicant number of exceptions In Table we present our results for a primary examina tion of the costs and gains of data rebalancing for HBase and Cassandra Beggining with an node cluster in each case we insert M tuples Following data insertion we expand each cluster with more nodes let the systems stabilize without performing data rebalancing and apply a UNIFORM READ workload with a Kreqssec load These results are presented in the No column for every database Afterwards a manual data rebalancing operation is performed in HBase through the HDFS balancer and Cassandra through loadbalance commands Once DB data are balanced we apply a UNIFORM READ workload with a Kreqss for HBase and Cassandra The results for this setup are depicted in the Reb column for each database From Table we can deduce that the data rebalancing costs far outweigh its benets for both HBase and Cassandra For HBase a net gain of about in throughput Kreqssec balanced vs Kreqssec not balanced was achieved compared to a nonrebalanced node cluster In Cassandra s case the results were better with a net gain of for the average throughput Kreqssec vs Kreqssec for a non balanced node cluster In terms of latency similar performance benets were achieved and for HBase and Cassandra respectively The data moved during data rebalancing for HBase are roughly GB or of the entire dataset In Cassandra s case much more data are moved GB in total which translates to the whole dataset as HDFS s centralized balancer is more advanced than Cassandra s when deciding how many data blocks to move to the new nodes as it takes into account replica locations to minimize transferred data Such a behavior leaves the cluster unbalanced in terms of disk usage but it signicantly reduces rebalancing time compared to Cassandra In Cassandra s case a decentralized but more naive and less ecient in terms of data movement approach is used to balance the cluster which divides the ID space of a preexisting node and assignes one part to a newly introduced node httpbitlyiCNsbF httpbitlykEZZFI As time costs for data rebalancing operations are large and minutes in HBase and Cassandra respectively and since the benets can be outweighed by adding more nodes without data migration which incurrs a xed time cost of minutes for each DB as shown in our results we conclude the costs outweigh the gains when aiming for the highest degree of elasticity Therefore subsequent tests were run without performing data rebalancing operations Resizing gains Our evaluation continues by identifying the gains in performance when adding nodes under varying workloads without data rebalancing for HBase and Cassandra We study the behaviour exhibited by an node cluster under varying workloads after the addition of a variable number of nodes We utilize a YCSBgenerated load of Kreqssec which is well over the maximum load that both Cassandra and HBase can eciently handle deployed on an node cluster Two types of workloads are used UNIFORM READ and UNIFORM UPDATE referred to as READ and UPDATE henceforth For each combination of workload and database we perform an addition of ie double the size and ie triple the size nodes The cluster resize occurs at about t sec shown in Figures and as a vertical line The clientside query latency and throughput are measured as well as the total aggregate cluster CPU usage reported by the Ganglia tool In Figure we present our results for the HBase cluster Legends refer to the workload type along with the resizing action eg READ represents a read workload with an node resize As read operations are faster than writes we achieve comparable run times by adjusting the amount of objects requested in each workload ie M in READ and M in UPDATE The rst graph presents the mean query latency Adding nodes during READ loads READ and READ has a transient negative eect on query latency as HMaster reassigns regions to the new nodes when the addition is performed Although data is not moved the reassignment poses an extra burden to the already overloaded cluster Clients cache region locations which however change during cluster resizing Consequently latency increases due to client cache misses This eect lasts for around minutes when adding nodes and just a couple of minutes when adding nodes with query latency less aected during the latter transition This is because more servers quickly join the cluster taking a large portion of the applied load The nodes in total can now handle the load Consequently the transient period takes less time and clients are aected less In the update workloads we notice an oscillation in both cases This happens because of the compaction and caching mechanisms of HBase Incoming data is cached in memory resulting in low update latencies but when the memory is full and a IO ush occurs with a compaction the latency increases until the new blocks are written to the le system The nal graph reports the aggregate cluster CPU usage as registered by the Ganglia tool In the read workloads we notice that the initial load of around is reduced to about in both cases Evidently the newly arrived nodes immediately start handling incoming queries and alleviate the initially overloaded cluster The addition of against nodes does not result in a further decrease in the average CPU as the load is still large enough for all servers to contribute The extra nodes make a dierence in terms of throughput as shown in the second graph Contrarily a Figure Query latency query throughput and CPU usage per time for an HBase cluster of nodes after adding and more nodes for the UNIFORM READ and UNIFORM UPDATE workload with a query Figure Query latency query throughput and CPU usage per time for a Cassandra cluster of nodes after adding and more nodes for the UNIFORM READ and UNIFORM UPDATE workload with a query rate of Kreqssec Figure SPARQL querying architecture drop in CPU usage is a good indication for adding servers against the maximum load In the update workloads we notice that in both experiments the initial CPU load continues to drop until run completion This drop is due to the slow writes that occur during updates The server freezes incoming requests until the updated regions are ushed to the le system In Figure we present the respective results for the Cas sandra cluster In each test clients request M each out of the total M objects stored in the database During the experiment clients are aware of the list of server addresses and each request is directed to a random one As Cassandra does not have a mechanism to inform clients about new servers a custom script was developed to propagate these changes back to the clients whenever a cluster resize occurred The rst graph presents query latency In both READ cases we notice that the latency almost immediately drops from an initial value of around secs to and secs respectively New servers are assigned half of the data partitions of existing servers they cache portions of their data and answer queries on their behalf The larger the resize the bigger the decrease in latency The same hold for the update workloads Adding more nodes reduces the query latency from sec to around in the UPDATE case and to around in the UPDATE case Again we notice here that writes are in general faster than reads due to the weak consistency model followed by Cassandra where writes do not have to be propagated to every replica holder for the operation to succeed Query throughput shows a similar trend Both in read and update workloads we notice the almost linear eect of adding new nodes Read throughput is increased from an initial value of Kreqssec to Kreqssec when nodes are added and to Kreqssec when nodes are added Update throughput is increased from around Kreqssec to Kreqssec in the case and to Kreqssec in the case This behaviour is expected since extra servers immediately join the pp ring and take portions of the applied workload Moreover the asynchronous nature of eventual consistency enables Cassandra to maintain a stable throughput rate even in a writeheavy workload Updates are successful upon transmitting the object to a single server which replicates it later on in a lazy manner Finally in the third graph of Figure we present the vari ation of the total cluster s CPU usage during time In the read case we notice that adding nodes slightly decreases the initial CPU usage to around whereas adding extra servers decreases the average CPU load to around Same as HBase the load of the node cluster shows that the applied load is big enough for every server to contribute since new servers are not idle The same hold for the update workloads more nodes bring the load to around and the addition of nodes drops the load to around Update workloads are more computationally heavy than simple reads as in the update case there is an extra disk access cost that is avoidable by caching fetched results In this kind of setting we note how both NoSQL systems take advantage of the addition of extra nodes HBase performs faster concurrent reads compared to Cassandra In the READ case it can handle Kreqssec with a latency of about secs and an aggregate CPU usage of whereas Cassandra s throughput is Kreqssec a latency of around secs and a higher CPU usage of On the other hand Cassandra is more ecient with object updates It maintains stable throughput and latency curves avoiding oscillations that occur with HBase Finally we notice that Cassandra does not exhibit a negative transient eect when new nodes enter the ring Its decentralized architecture allows for a transparent cluster resize whereas in HBase the HMaster needs to coordinate the whole procedure Elasticityprovisioning prototype In this section we present some initial results achieved using our framework to deploy a fully automatic cluster resize system Our goal is to demonstrate the eectiveness and modularity of our design to allow for adaptive cluster resize without any human involvement We argue that Tiramola s elastic HBase implementation can be used by higher level applications making them elastic and robust to load variances To showcase Tiramola s elasticity provisioning we utilize it on a SPARQL querying application prototype that depends on HBase to access data SPARQL querying architecture In this section we focus on achieving scalable and ecient concurrent execution of selective SPARQL queries Figure depicts the functional overview of our RDF store prototype A number of HBase servers Region servers maintains the triples indexed using permutations spo osp pos Moreover a number of query processing servers Query executors receive user requests run the task of collecting data from the various Region servers and locally perform the join task Queries can be formed in the well known SPARQL standard Dierent query executor instances can process queries independently and provide concurrent query throughput To coordinate the several executor instances we utilize a zookeeper quorum The zookeeper allows scalable and fault tolerant synchronization between large number of machines To handle large query throughput we implement a distributed query queue using the zookeeper Clients connect to the zookeeper and send their queries to the queue On the other side executors also connect to the zookeeper and constantly check the queue for input queries The query execution servers reside in dierent nodes of the cluster and can be added or removed at will Therefore our architecture is elastic in both HBase and query execution layer which means that we can independently change both the number of HBase and query execution servers There are two main factors that aect query throughput First SPARQL query throughput highly relies on HBase s read throughput Using a large number of query execution servers can result in load that overcomes HBase s max read throughput In that case executors will stall and HBase will become the throughput s bottleneck Another factor that limits the number of servers is the number of CPUs available in each cluster s node If a node executes more query server instances than its CPU capacity server threads will be stalled and their execution will be serialized In order to achieve full elasticity we must ensure that adding more cluster nodes will result in increased query throughput Each node has virtual CPU cores To avoid CPU overutilization we launch server instances on each node one for every virtual CPU available on the node From our HBase elasticity experiments we know that adding more HBase region servers results in increased read throughput which will be able to withstand the increased amount of query execution servers Thus we choose to add one more HBase region server for every node in the cluster Using two query execution servers and one HBase region server on each separate cluster s VM provides a fully scalable and elastic SPARQL querying architecture Elastic SPARQL querying experiments In order to provide a realistic webscale evaluation we utilize the LUBM dataset generator LUBM creates RDF datasets with information taken from the academic domain enabling a variable number of generated triples by controlling the number of university entities A LUBM dataset of thousand universities that contains approximately million triples GB of raw data is loaded using a MapReduce bulk import job that creates three distributed HBase indices We test our system s elasticity in concurrent query throughput with a load consisting of queries with the form SELECT x WHERE x rdftype ubGraduateStudent x ubtakesCourse This query retrieves all graduate students that take a certain course It consists of triple pattern queries that are joined by a single variable To generate random load we use for each query a dierent randomly selected course and put it in the second triple query pattern In order to demonstrate the elasticity properties of our implementation we utilize a long running sinusoidal load using a multithreaded client that queries our application using an average of SPARQL queries per second a peak load of queries per second and a period of hour SPARQL queries are translated into multiple HBase index accesses which means that a load of SPARQL queries per second can result in a load of thousand HBase reads per second This simulates a very fast variable load that is common for most cloud applications We expect that our commandissuing module will autonomously decide to add nodes as the load increases beyond the server s capability and then return to the original cluster size once the extra load has faded Using our knowledge of the database s operating limits outlined in the previous experiments we have congured the commandissuing module accordingly The parameter to trigger node addition is increasing CPU usage of over measured as an average over all servers that compose the cluster This measure takes into account the extra processing required for our application s joins and is therefore set higher than our previous NoSQL examination would suggest is necessary On the other hand to remove a node our threshold is average CPU usage of or lower To avoid oscillations as CPU usage could vary greatly during normal operation the commandissuing module monitors a running average of CPU usage with a time window of minutes Large variations that might occur during this period are considered transient and are taken into account as an average since the system would not have time to act in this small time period In Figure we present our experimental results for a man aged node cluster At the beginning of the experiment the high load forces the CPU usage to high levels and given that the load is extreme for the size of the cluster the queue size increases rapidly With the addition of one node the queue size returns to normal but given the minimal decrease in Figure CPU queue length Input load and throughput for our elasticity prototype under sinusoidal load changes cpu usage over the previous time period the system adds more nodes to the cluster The increased throughput is achieved and once the peak load has subsided CPU usage drops and the queue length approaches zero so our framework removes nodes from the cluster one by one in order to retain the cluster data which are stored in HBase The experiment then proceeds in a similar fashion which validates the behavior of the system under similar conditions Although node addition and removal incurs a cost thus causing the cluster to perform erratically during the procedure manifesting in the throughput and queue length graphs the gains are evident First the cluster uses the minimum number of nodes required for good operation in our example nodes for most of the time with a maximum of needed for the brief high load periods which translates to reduced operational costs Second our approach guarantees quality of service for users even under heavy load as requests are answered in a timely manner and the service cluster is always online RELATED WORK A literature study about the challenges of scaling whole applications in cloud environments is presented in along with an overview of state of the art eorts towards that goal In the authors propose a service specication lan guage for cloud computing platforms that handles automatic deployment and exible scaling of services Similarly the work in designs a model implementing an elastic site re source manager that dynamically consolidates remote cloud resources on demand based on predened policies and a prototype for extending Torque clusters The works in solve the problem of optimizing VM resources CPU memory etc to achieve maximum performance using relational DBs In comparison we use the standard VM model that large cloud providers currently oer As a general observation these works do not address NoSQL systems and their performance under dynamic cluster resizes Herodotou et al present the Elastizer a system for au tomatic sizing of a MapReduce cluster according to workload proling When the user denes the job s prole through a set of parameters Elastizer determines the amount of cluster resources by utilizing training sets of previous runs in order to optimize the job s execution Their approach can be applied only to batchoriented data analytics tasks whereas Tiramola can be applied to any application The work in presents policies for elastically scaling the Hadoopbased storagetier of multitier Web services based on automated control Oppositely we studied NoSQL systems that store structured data and are easier to manipulate in the application level We converge in adopting the same metric CPU Utilization and evaluating rebalancing costs The main dierence is that this approach is HDFSspecic since monitoring was integrated in HDFS nodes while data rebalance is mandatory for new nodes However our framework uses an external monitoring tool Ganglia that is generic for any NoSQL system and rebalancing need not be forced as it relates to the NoSQL system used A thorough analysis of various proprietary NoSQLlike cloud services namely Google s AppEngine Microsoft s SQL Azure and Amazon s SimpleDB is presented in The authors test system aspects such as scalability cost and performance using the TCPW benchmark All systems are treated as black boxes since no information about their design or implementation is assumed to be known In contrast our system is fully aware of the dierent engines mechanisms Moreover we utilize our measurements to present a modular framework that can be used to realize automatic clusterresizing Cloudy is a cloudenabled framework which supports autoscaling features according to demand providing simple keyvalue putget primitives Nevertheless compared to our system it is not designed to support numerous NoSQL databases In NEFELI cloud users inform the cloud management framework with hints about the application nature and the framework modies its scheduling policies to improve application performance The dierence is the need for a middleware to be installed inside the cloud management layer whereas our framework utilizes only the cloud client tools being completely agnostic about the internals of the cloud management platform enabling it to be installed over various platforms CloudWatch is Amazon s commercial product for mon itoring and managing cloud resources CloudWatch oers a set of metrics for every VM instance and a policy framework to trigger balancing actions when some conditions are met Its metric support is limited oering only hypervisorrelated information such as CPU usage and network trac Memory usage or applicationspecic metrics are not supported out of the box in contrast to Ganglia which apart from its own rich set of probes has inherent support from many applications including some NoSQL systems CloudWatch as a general purpose tool does not have inherent support for NoSQL thus the extra coding to recongure the application cluster after a hardware resize is not avoided Other frameworks for commercial cloud platforms like AzureWatch feature similar characteristics resulting in vendor lockins CONCLUSIONS This work presents an extensive study that quanties and analyzes the costs and gains of various NoSQL cluster resize operations utilizing two popular NoSQL implementations To perform our study we designed and implemented a fully modular cloudenabled framework that allows ecient resource monitoring and direct interaction with the cloud vendor and the cluster manager We have also evluated the performance gains that a distributed application utilizing a NoSQL database backend can achieve by exploiting the elasticity oered by modern cloud infrastructures The ease of setup and the performance under elastic operations weigh on choosing a particular NoSQL Both engines we tested can be setup with relative ease There are few conguration les that need to be injected during launch and most of the operational parameters can be adjusted by altering the appropriate settings There is no need to provide new conguration les or commands during normal operation especially during the rebalancing phases Nevertheless their quite distinctive behavior and performance under different scenarios make the decision quite applicationspecic HBase is the fastest and scales with node additions only for reads though while Cassandra performs fast writes and scales also without any transitional phase during node additions Both achieve small gains from a data rebalance provided they are under minimal load We believe that this work has demonstrated the feasibility of our ultimate goal Based on our ndings we oered a prototype implementation of our automatic cluster resize module that matches the number of provisioned resources against the total demand and the application expert s rules of required operation We have also demonstrated the gains of a SPARQL query server application using HBase as an RDF store under variable query load and elastic operations Our opensource implementation can provide a good basis on which numerous applications can test their adaptivity at veryhigh scale REFERENCES Amazon CloudWatch
